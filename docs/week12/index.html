      game</h3>
      <p>Today we’ll be making a VUI game. Drawing on our previous
      experience throughout the semester to make text user interfaces,
      then graphic user interfaces, and now voice user interfaces
      students will work in teams to create a compelling game playable
      via voice user interface.</p>
      <p>Categories: - a quiz game - a choose-your-own-adventure style
      branching narrative game - a “facts” application - a gambling game
      - something else!</p>
      <p>Process:</p>
      <p>Talk. What are you interested in? What questions do you have?
      Can you come to an agreement on something you are excited about?
      What kinds of skills do you have and what will you need to
      learn?</p>
      <p>What’s your working process? (Suggestion: Do a flowchart first.
      Then create a spreadsheet of utterances)</p>
      <p>Your final game must include:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>a playable game!</li>
      <li>an introduction</li>
      <li>“help”</li>
      <li>“credits” - listing everyone involved</li>
      <li>a way to reset - e.g. “start over”</li>
      <li>win/lose conditions</li>
      <li>suggestions for what to do in case the VUI doesn’t understand
      what someone said</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Important: to be considered complete each student
      should include a link to the final project, list your name, and
      list your collaborators. Address: How does your program work? How
      did you work collaboratively? (What roles did people take, if
      any). What challenges did you find? And anything else about the
      process. 1 to 3 paragraphs</strong></p>
