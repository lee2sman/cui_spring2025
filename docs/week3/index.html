      <p>Proposed three modes of interfaces with computers:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><em>desk surfaces</em> - can be drawn on and interpreted by
      the computer</li>
      <li><em>networked wall and desk displays</em> - for collaboration
      and for input to the computer</li>
      <li><em>speech recognition</em> - to give input to the
      computer</li>

      <blockquote>
      <p>‘the real problem with the interface is that it is an
      interface. Interfaces get in the way. I don’t want to focus my
      energies on an interface. I want to focus on the job. When I use
      my computer , it is in order to get a job done: I don’t want to
      think of myself as using a computer, I want to think of myself as
      doing my job.’</p>

      <p>This is the install screen for Testfairy, an app for Android
      that lets developers test out apps before releasing them to a
      wider public.</p>
      <p>This screen is essentially like a full size dialogue. It
      contains:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>basic info</li>
      <li>a link to install the app</li>
      <li>info on how to use the app</li>
      <li>marketing text</li>
      <li>contact info</li>
      <li>link to read terms</li>
      <li>the ability to report spam</li>
      <li>Unsubscribe</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That is a lot of text for an app interface. It contains a link
      to download the app as well as instructions to use the app, which
      you’d have to memorize as clicking to install and opening the app
      would be on a separate screen.</p>
      <p>This is not very learnable!</p>
      <h3 id="human-short-term-memory">Human short-term memory</h3>
      <p>One model for understanding human memory is that we have
      working memory and longterm memory. Working memory is where we do
      our active <em>thinking</em>. Studies generally indicate we have a
      limited amount of elements we can actively engage with in our
      short term memory, generally framed as around 7 items.</p>
      <p>We need to limit the user’s options so as not to overload their
      active working memory.</p>
      <h3 id="three-types-of-interaction-styles">Three types of
      interaction styles</h3>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>Command language</li>
      <li>Menus / forms</li>
      <li>Direct maniulation</li>
      </ol>
      <h3 id="command-language">1. Command language</h3>
      <p>The command line is a command language. These are the earliest
      type of computer interfaces (see week 1 notes).</p>
      <p>As an example, a Google/DuckDuckGo/Bing search bar creates a
      command language query.</p>
      <p><code>computer science site:purchase.edu</code></p>
      <p>We can consider a Voice User Interface as another manifestation
      of a command language.</p>
      <h3 id="menus-forms">2. Menus / forms</h3>
      <p>Menus / form interfaces are a more recent interaction model
      than command language but have been around at least since the 80s.
      The earliest websites (90s) behave this way.</p>
      <p>Dialog boxes are essentially simplified forms.</p>
      <p>They can provide a clear if unglamorous interface.</p>

      <h3 id="direct-manipulation">3. Direct manipulation</h3>
      <p>Direct manipulation is the term we use for a interface where a
      user interacts with a visual representation of a data object.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>There are physical actions such as dragging on scrollbars or
      pressing a button</li>
      <li>fast, incremental, reversible</li>
      <li>immediate visual indication of an action taking effect</li>
      </ul>

      <li>consider which requires the user to hold more things in their
      head at once</li>
      <li>error feedback</li>

      <li>user types</li>
      <li>which is better for experts?</li>
      <li>for beginners?</li>
      <li><strong>programming difficulty</strong></li>
      <li>command languages are relatively easy to create</li>
      <li>direct manipulations requires graphics which require both
      commands as well as creating the visual interface</li>
      <li>accessibility</li>
      <li>command languages and menus and forms are based on text so can
      be easier for vision-impaired users</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="model-of-a-system">Model of a system</h3>
      <p>The <strong>model</strong> of a system is the sum of the
      constituent parts of a system and how they work together. It
      describes how those parts work and interact to make a system do
      something.</p>
      <h3 id="system-model---how-the-system-actually-works">System model
      - how the system actually works</h3>
      <h3
      id="interface-model---the-model-that-gets-presented-to-the-user-through-its-interface">Interface
      model - the model that gets presented to the user through its
      interface</h3>
      <h3 id="user-model---how-the-user-thinks-the-system-works">User
      model - how the user thinks the system works</h3>
      <p>The interface model must be</p>
      <ul>
      <li>simple</li>
      <li>match the user’s conception of the needed task</li>
      <li>clear</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Interface models should give immediate feedback. Consider what
      happens when you push a button or drag a scrollbar. Feedback
      should be visual but can also be audio (clicking sound for
      example).</p>
      <p>Interfaces should be consistent, not surprising. For best
      practices, follow what popular programs or platforms do.</p>
      <p>Interfaces should use common words, not technical jargon.</p>

      <h3 id="reading-response">Reading Response</h3>
      <p>Read David Reinfurt chapter “Touch Start to Begin” (20 minute
      read) about his experience as a professional designer that
      designed the Metrocard machines for the New York City subway.</p>
      <p>Response: Write a short response (1/2 a page) to this reading.
      What did you find surprising or new to you in Reinfurt’s
      description of the design of the MTA Metrocard screens? In your
      own words: what was the design methodology (sequence of design)
      they went through from ideation to implementation, testing, to
      final public version of the system?</p>

      <h3 id="complete-project-1-command-line-interface">Complete
      project 1: Command Line Interface</h3>
      <p>Work with a partner to design a Command Line Interface for a
      program of your choice. You could make music playing software, a
      countdown timer, a program that reads aloud to the user, a to-do
      list maker, a meditation app, a sleep machine, or something
      else.</p>
      <p>Create a menu by printing out options for the user. Use the
      select command to run a function based on the user selection.</p>
      <p>In class we learned you can combine command line software
      together. In this assignment you should consider what building
      blocks from BASH you will use to make your software. We can
      consider gluing these program bits together similar to sticking
      together lego blocks.</p>
      <p>Basic script built out of separate program parts:</p>
      <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
      class="sourceCode sh"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># this is a comment. Use them!</span></span>

      <p>You are welcome to use other BASH commands and programs as
      well, along with our starter menu scripts.</p>
      <p>In addition to a functional piece of software, consider how a
      prominent title, emojis and/or ascii art could help or hinder your
      software. How can color help make your interface more useable
      and/or fun? How can you make the program more discoverable with
      help?</p>
      <p>For homework, finish your program, working with your partner on
      your CLI program, getting the main concept developed along with
      creating your working program loop. You will likely have a loop
      that checks for user input, then displays a result based on what
      the user selects from a menu.</p>
