      <p><strong>What is an interface?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>What is a <em>user interface</em>?</strong></p>
      <p>Well?! What is it?</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>The space where interactions between humans and machines occur.
      The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and
      control of the machine from the human end, whilst the machine
      simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators'
      decision-making process. Examples of this broad concept of user
      interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer operating
      systems, hand tools, heavy machinery operator controls, and
      process controls. The design considerations applicable when
      creating user interfaces are related to or involve such
      disciplines as ergonomics and psychology. Generally, the goal of
      user interface design is to produce a user interface which makes
      it easy, efficient, and enjoyable (user-friendly) to operate a
      machine in the way which produces the desired result. This
      generally means that the operator needs to provide minimal input
      to achieve the desired output, and also that the machine minimizes
      undesired outputs to the human. <em>--<a

      Archives and Records Administration</em></p>
      <p>The earliest era of computer / machine interfaces centered on
      the <em>batch interface</em>. Punch cards were the primary method
      to input data. Special key punch card were manually punched and
      batch-processed when fed into a machine. The result could be a
      printout or mechanical operation. Errors were common, and could be
      hard to understand, and in addition to syntax errors (erros from
      typing the code incorrectly) there could also be mechanical
      errors. Running these batches of punchcards could take a very long
      time: hours or days until a result was produced.</p>

      <p><em>Teletype Model 33 ASR</em></p>
      <p>Batch interfaces evolved over time into command line
      interfaces, which are input as text queries to a main system
      console. The system responds with output, usually text.</p>
      <p>Early command line interfaces used a typewriter keyboard for
      input and teleprinters for output. Teleprinters evolved out of
      technology used for the telegraph since 1902, and later used in
      newsrooms to transmit information. In the 1970s video monitors
      became more common. Text output could be seen quicker. And simple
      pictures constructed out of text started to be seen.</p>

      <p>The text user interface is still very relevant in the modern
      era, though mostly of use to expert users and fellow programmers.
      It can provide more comprehensive options, configurability and can
      be automated in ways that graphical interfaces cannot.</p>

      <p>Doug Engelbart was a pioneering inventor and engineer working
      in human-computer interaction. At SRI International he led the
      Augmentation Research Center Lab and was responsible for
      developing the mouse, versions of hypertext, networking between
      computers, and early graphic user interfaces.</p>
      <p>There is a clear mission embedded in the title
      <em>Aumentation</em> Research Center. Computers then, as now, were
      seen as devices to augment the capacity of humans. They were tools
      created and intended to extend our own innate abilities.</p>

      <p>Apple Macintosh computers were a huge success. They
      demonstrated that a GUI could help sell computers to a more

      previously attracting.</p>

      <em>Microsoft Bob, 1995</em></p>
      <p>In 1995, Microsoft attempted a radical reimagining of the
      desktop metaphor (also known as WIMP - Windows, Icons, Mice,
      Pointer) pioneered by Xerox Parc and adapted by Apple, Windows and
      others. They created a virtual 3D room scene populated by cartoon
      creatures and objects as an overlaid interface to the operating
      system. It was widely criticized and was quickly dropped by
      Microsoft. Users found it clunky, ugly, confusing. Microsoft
      Word's Clippy was a continuation of Microsoft Bob, also disliked
      by users, and was also eventually removed from the software.</p>

      <p>Note: These are non-professional programs made in the 90s,
      generally for personal use or small communities. They may contain
      inappropriate or strange content! Use at your own risk. You can
      also flag content on Archive.org.</p>
      <p>These run slow! Your own mouse does not necessarily align

      the tiny digital ones on our wrist. He goes on to describe the
      evolution of the Apple operating system and its interface and the
      influence of Susan Kare’s icons.</p>
      <p>It’s now over 35 years since the release of the first
      Macintosh. What assumptions (or not) or previous knowledge was
      Apple making that influenced the design of their first Macintosh
      operating system and its interface. Who dd they think of their
      audience and how did they build their interfaces to accomodate
      their needs? How might Apple think of its users now, and how would
      that alter what kinds of interfaces are built and with what
      assumptions?</p>
