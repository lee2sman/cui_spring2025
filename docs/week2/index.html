      <p><strong>Note for Windows users: I’m sorry to say this, but the
      <em>standard</em> text interface is Linux! Macintosh computers
      have access to this under the hood because they are built on top
      of BSD, which uses the same commands as Linux. PC users, your
      Windows Powershell is fundamentally different, and so you should
      use Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong>.</p>
      <h1 id="text-user-interfaces-1">Text User Interfaces</h1>
      <p>Last week we looked at a history of interfaces and operating
      systems.</p>
      <p>Review: What is a User Interface?</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Yet with its creaky, decades-old constraints and inexplicable
      quirks, the command line is still the most versatile corner of the
      computer. It lets you pull back the curtain, see what’s really
      going on, and creatively interact with the machine at a level of
      sophistication and depth that GUIs cannot afford. It’s available
      on almost any laptop, for anyone who wants to learn it. It can be
      used interactively, or it can be automated. And, it doesn’t change
      as fast as other parts of the system. There is creative value in
      its stability. <em>–source: <a href="https://clig.dev/">Command
      Line Interface Guidelines</a></em></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In the <em>early years</em> of computing, we had circuits,
      switches, lights, and dials. Later came punch cards for
      calculations and storing data and programs. Still later came
      terminals, which were monitors connected to a computer. We input
      commands to the computer through a Teletype typewriter. Output
      would be printed out or displayed on the terminal monitor.</p>
      <p>Computers are complex. IC chips that computers were built from,
      especially in the earlier years, were expensive. Because of this,
      computers had a minimal amount of memory. Text was much easier to
      store and work with, so the priority was placed on text. This
      became the primary way to interact with a computer.</p>

      example command line interface</p>
      <p>The command line interface is a text-only interface. Where the
      user types in commands is known as the <em>prompt</em>. A user
      types in commands; then the output is displayed immediately. And a
      user may then type in more commands, with more output, in a
      continuous cycle.</p>
      <p>Some advantages: - A “powerful” environment. Everything can be
      done on one screen, in one location. Commands can be combined
      together. - Commands are “conversational”. They can evolve over
      time, iteratively. - They can be automated.</p>
      <p>Disadvantages: - “Discoverability” problem. Which commands are
      available? How do you use them? What options exist? - Expertise
      needed to get started and to advance. Not beginner-friendly.</p>
      <p>Macintosh computers were the first mass-market computers to
      popularize taking a graphics-first approach to computer
      interfaces. The Mac Human User Interface guidelines were printed
      in 1987. They emphasized “see and point” instead of remember and
      type.</p>

      Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy Game</p>
      <p>You can see in this screen a text-based game. These were
      similar to “Choose your own adventure” style books you may have
      read as a kid, or other branching narratives, but they had much
      more functionality. Not only did you advance in a story, but you
      had inventory, could solve puzzles, join battles and more.</p>
      <p>This program uses a parser. The parser is the interface that
      runs through commands you type in and then executes code depending
      on your commands.</p>
      <p>These types of games attempted to use a more natural
      <em>language</em>, but they could still have problems with their
      commands being unclear.</p>
      <p>Over time, programmers attempted to use space and to make these
      programs more <em>visual</em>.</p>

      A simpler text user interface example. You can see how this
      approaches a traditional graphic user interface in design.</p>
      <p>These kinds of programs that run in the command line are called
      Text User Interfaces.</p>

      <p>Some of these programs started using color. They can be quite
      complex.</p>

      This is an example of Microsoft Exchange, the email system our
      school uses, navigated in DOS with a Text User Interface.</p>
      <p>You’ll notice this program almost appears to be a GUI. It even
      has menus.</p>

      <h1 id="workshop">Workshop</h1>
      <p>Basic commands today</p>
      <p>To move around:</p>
      <pre><code>cd [foldername]</code></pre>
      <p>To move around (“change directory”) in folders on our
      computer.</p>
      <pre><code>ls</code></pre>
      <p>To list files in a folder.</p>
      <pre><code>pwd</code></pre>
      <p>To remind you what folder you are in. (aka “print working
      directory”)</p>
      <pre><code>cat [filename]</code></pre>
      <p>This prints out the text of a file onto the screen.</p>
      <pre><code>man [program-name]</code></pre>
      <p>This starts up the computer <em>manual</em> for a command line
      program. You can scroll up and down and press <strong>Q</strong>
      when you are finished reading to exit.</p>
      <pre><code>echo &quot;text&quot;</code></pre>
      <p>Prints out text.</p>
      <p><strong>When you get stuck, Control-C usually is the CANCEL
      command</strong>. Though a few use <em>Control-D</em>.</p>
      <h3 id="workshop-creating-simple-text-user-interfaces.">Workshop:
      Creating simple text user interfaces.</h3>
      <p>BASH</p>
      <pre><code>#!/bin/bash
# Ask the user for their name

echo &quot;Hello, who am I talking to?&quot;
read varname
echo &quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you $varname&quot;</code></pre>
      <h3 id="in-class-pizza-order-calculator">In-class: Pizza Order
      Calculator</h3>
      <p>Your goal: design command line software for determining the
      total number of pizzas to order for a group of people.</p>
      <p>Your software should be useable by a variety of people, from
      beginners to command line interfaces to advanced users.</p>
      <p>Your program should have help, be intuitive, and ideally,
      powerful.</p>
      <p>At minimum, your program should ask for the total number of
      people, then print out the ideal number of pizzas to order.</p>
      <p>Other optional things to consider adding: Do you want to tailor
      your program for kids vs adults, how hungry you are, various sizes
      of pizza, or what toppings people like?</p>
      <p>Things to consider: - adding ascii art - adding a menu - adding
      help - adding “power features”</p>
      <p>Please note that there is not one definitive best way to
      calculate. Figure out a formula that seems right to you. You will
      see a variety of potential formulas online, including the “3/8”
      rule.</p>

      <h2 id="homework-code-a-text-user-interface">Homework: Code a Text
      User Interface</h2>
      <p>Due in 2 weeks:</p>
      <p>Work with a partner to design a Text User Interface for a
      program of your choice. You could make music playing software, a
      countdown timer, a program that reads aloud to the user, a to-do
      list maker, a meditation app, a sleep machine, or something
      else.</p>
      <p>Create a menu by printing out options for the user.<br />
      Use the select command to run a function based on the user
      selection.</p>
      <p>In class we learned you can combine command line software
      together. In this assignment you should consider what building
      blocks from BASH you will use to make your software. We can
      consider gluing these program bits together similar to sticking
      together lego blocks.</p>
      <p>Recommended program parts to use in your software:</p>
      <pre><code># this is a comment. Use them!

echo &quot;some text&quot; # prints text out

echo -e &quot;some text
on two lines&quot;

read -$ &quot;Enter your name &quot; yourname
#Prompts with &quot;Enter your name&quot; and saves in $yourname
#Don&#39;t forget variables are used starting with $

say &quot;something&quot; # speaks text out loud

afplay file.mp3 # plays an audio file

sleep 10 # sleeps (waits) 10 seconds
</code></pre>
      <p>This should be all you need to make an interesting basic CLI
      program. You are welcome to use other BASH commands and programs
      as well.</p>
      <p>Your final program will be due in 2 weeks. In addition to a
      function piece of software, consider how a prominent title, emojis
      and/or ascii art could help or hinder your software. How can color
      help make your interface more useable and/or fun? How can you make
      the program more discoverable with help?</p>
      <p>You have two weeks to finish your CLI program. For homework,
      continue to work with your partner on your CLI program, getting
      the main concept developed along with creating your working
      program loop. You will likely have a loop that checks for user
      input, then displays a result based on what the user selects from
      a menu. Next week we will be doing user testing and build in a
      ‘help’ command to our programs.</p>
      <h3 id="homework-reading">Homework: Reading</h3>
      <p>Due Next week:</p>
      <p>Read the excerpt from Design/Interface in The Interface
      Experience, up to page 58 in the book (which is 23 pages of the
      pdf).</p>
      <p>Write: In The Interface Experience what concepts from earlier
      media theorists, technicians and designers stick out to you that
      can inform our user interface design work?</p>
      <h3 id="homework-user-interface-wall-of-shame">Homework: User
      Interface Wall of Shame</h3>
      <p>Due Next Week:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Read <a href="https://outline.com/L6bNfh">Blame terrible
      interface design for the Hawaii missile alert debacle</a></li>
      <li>Write: What are examples of bad interfaces you can find in
      your environment around you? This could be on your phone,
      computer, but also in the environment around you (doctor’s
      offices, a plane, elevators, public spaces). Take pictures and/or
      screenshots of at least 2 interfaces that perform poorly. Write a
      page, including your images, and describe what the interface is
      for and why it fails. What did the interface designer fail to take
      into account? How could the interface be improved? Keep in mind
      that interfaces can often feature examples of both good and bad
      design. If there’s any part of the interface design that’s
      redeeming, describe what parts you think are effective.</li>
