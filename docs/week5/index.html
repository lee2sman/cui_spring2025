      <h2 id="intro-to-user-experience-design-methodology">Intro to User
      Experience Design Methodology</h2>
      <p>Recall that this method is in contrast to the “Waterfall”
      method. Instead of lots of research from a client with a long
      design-build stage we will do iterative rapid prototyping with
      potential users of our interface.</p>
      <h3 id="create-a-design-brief">1. Create a Design Brief</h3>
      <p>Ask yourself “what is the problem I’m actually trying to
      solve?”</p>
      <p>It may be for a new interface and project, or an adaptation to
      one that already exists.</p>
      <p>Answering this question results in your <em>project brief</em>
      and indicates your goal. This is the purpose of your interface and
      application. The answer should be a succinct statement focused on
      your audience and goals.</p>
      <p>You should place this design brief in a prominent position.
      Return to it throughout the project design to make sure you’re
      keeping to your goals. You may want to alter and refine it as you
      work on the project.</p>
      <h4 id="co-design-with-stakeholders">2. Co-Design with
      Stakeholders</h4>
      <p>Once you have your design brief you need to verify that this
      matches your audience’s needs and goals.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>The next step is to research the challenge and learn about the
      problem. What you need to discover is whether your team’s
      understanding of the problem is valid. Quite often we look at
      problems from our own point of view, which is dangerous as most of
      us in tech are actually power users and are in fact a minority of
      users. We are a vocal minority and can be fooled into thinking
      something is actually a problem when it isn’t. <em>–Web UX
      Fundamentals, <a
      href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/ux-basics">Google
      Developers</a></em></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>There are a number of ways to do this including: internal
      interviews, user interviews, field research. Generally one method
      is used.</p>
      <h3 id="research-method-1---internal-reviews">Research Method 1 -
      Internal reviews</h3>
      <p>This is done with your own team/collaborators. Fast, find your
      best goals. Not as favored as independent user interviews.</p>
      <h3 id="research-method-2---user-interviews">Research Method 2 -
      User interviews</h3>
      <p>Convene at least five interviewees. Ask them questions relating
      to the design brief. This is considered the most ideal approach to
      follow when it’s feasible.</p>
      <p>Example questions: - what challenges do they face? - what do
      they already use to accomplish that task/activity? - show them
      prototypes - what do they like/dislike about this plan? - what
      similar programs do they like? - what would they change?</p>
      <p>The goal is to gather research/data, then update your design
      brief.</p>
      <h3 id="research-method-3">Research Method 3</h3>
      <p>Field Research means you find users in public and observe their
      behavior in context. Users may think they have a particular need
      or pattern, but it may turn out that their own actions diverge
      from what they think. In this method you observe without
      participating or interfering.</p>
      <p>Based on your gathered research, revise your design brief.</p>
      <h3 id="wireframing-activity-and-storyboarding">4. Wireframing
      Activity and Storyboarding</h3>
      <p>Using a notebook or digitally sketch simple wireframes and
      sketch layouts. These should be throwaway designs, very rapid.
      Iterate on your design until you feel satisfied with the basic
      layouts. You may want to sketch these to size. Remember these can
      be very loose or very detailed. Consider the sketchbook Metrocard
      screen sketches of David Reinfurt. He sketched out 4 potential
      layout options and then drew out a wireframe and storyboard
      showing the flow between screens.</p>
      <h3 id="prototyping">5. Prototyping</h3>
      <p>Based on your wireframe and storyboarding it’s time to build a
      prototype. You may begin with a more detailed paper prototype or
      be ready to jump to sketching digitally. We’ve covered a number of
      tools like Figma, Wireframe.cc, Sketch and even simplified
      applications like Keynote as prototyping tools. The goal of this
      step is to produce something that appears/looks like a real
      finished app. Remember however that you will do further
      refinements later based on user testing.</p>
      <h3 id="usability-testing">6. Usability Testing</h3>
      <p>Now is the time to gather people to test your design. You’ll
      let them interact with your prototype, by pressing, clicking,
      potentially “even Wizard of Oz” approaches like we learned about
      from David Reinfurt’s test of the prototype Metrocard screens.</p>
      <p>Like our earlier co-designing session it’s best to observe
      rather than engage in a back-and-forth conversation as you do not
      want to influence their actions. Ask questions to find out what
      the user likes, dislikes, finds intuitive, confusing, and whether
      it meets their needs.</p>
      <h3 id="refinement-and-building">7. Refinement and Building</h3>
      <p>Based on user usability testing you’ll go back to the design
      and refine it. You made need to do more usability testing.</p>
      <p>Based on this work it’s time to build the interface by
      translating your revised prototype into code.</p>
      <h3 id="user-testing-and-refinement-loop">8. User Testing (and
      Refinement) Loop</h3>
      <p>Like our earlier usability testing, after you’ve built the
      first version of the interface in code you’ll need to test and
      observe its use. Based on this you will likely need to do
      successive layers of building, refinement and testing until you
      get to a final version everyone is happy with.</p>

      Activity - Following our User Experience Design Methodology to
      create Prototypes and Crazy 8s</h2>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>Design brief</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Spend 10-20 minutes brainstorming <em>app</em> ideas that would
      augment your life, something that would be specific to you and/or
      perhaps a friend or family member. Just make a list. It’s
      important to get all of your ideas out. Good ideas, bad ideas.
      Capture the ideas down with a word or phrase or sentence. Don’t
      judge them yet. Don’t consider them in detail yet. Just put them
      down and let them sit in a list.</p>
      <ol start="2" type="1">
      <li>Research</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now find a partner and interview them. Conduct design research
      and from this create a design brief based on their needs. Spend a
      few minutes refining your concept. Ask them questions. Follow our
      User Experience Design Methodology.</p>
      <h3 id="in-class-activity---crazy-8s">In-class Activity - Crazy
      8s</h3>
      <ol start="3" type="1">
      <li>Paper Prototyping</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Fold a sheet of paper so you have 8 panels.</p>
      <figure>
      <img src="../images/crazy-8s.jpg"
      alt="Crazy 8s design prototyping activity" />
      <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Crazy 8s design prototyping
      activity</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In each panel draw a prototype sketch for your interface based
      on your research so far.</p>
      <p>⌛ You have exactly <a
      href="https://e.ggtimer.com/10%20minutes">10 minutes</a> to spend
      sketching 8 potential UIs. This is not a time for tiny
      details.</p>
      <ol start="4" type="1">
      <li>Refinement</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now meet with your partner and compare your designs. Spend a
      few minutes analyzing them. Which design seems most promising? Add
      any details that come up in discussion.</p>
      <ol start="5" type="1">
      <li>Paper Mockup</li>
      </ol>
      <p>⌛ Now spend 10 minutes sketching out one of the designs in
      more detail. You can each work separately or choose to work
      together.</p>
      <figure>
      <img src="../images/storyboard.jpg"
      alt="storyboarding an interface" />
      <figcaption aria-hidden="true">storyboarding an
      interface</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ol start="6" type="1">
      <li>Flowchart (Storyboard)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>⌛ From this sketched design it’s now time to draft a
      storyboard. This is a workflow showing step by step screens in
      successive order by a user. Sometimes you may want to demonstrate
      branching options and flows.</p>
      <p>Continue to follow the design methodology: - Prototyping -
      Usability testing - Refinement and further usability testing</p>
      <h3 id="wireframing-and-mockups">wireframing and mockups</h3>
      <ol start="7" type="1">
      <li>mockup with design software</li>
      </ol>
      <p>There are many programs free and paid for creating mockups of
      interfaces. Some of the most common are <a
      href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a>, a freemium/paid web-based
      application, and <a href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</a>, a
      Mac-only UI prototyping application that runs on the Mac desktop.
      Other options include Adobe’s XD, a freemium/paid Mac/Windows
      desktop software.</p>
      <p>Note: Freemium applications are paid for-profit software that
      also includes a <em>free tier</em> level of use. These free tiers
      are usually limited in their options, such as adding watermarks,
      preventing sharing or collaboration, or preventing saving or
      exporting.</p>
      <p>These programs work well, but I wanted to also present a free
      and open source wireframing/mockup tool:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><a href="https://mydraft.cc/">mydraft.cc</a> - simple and no
      sign-in</li>
      <li><a href="https://penpot.app/">penpot</a> - more full-featured,
      appears similar to Figma</li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
      <img src="../images/mydraft.jpg" alt="mydraft.cc" />
      <figcaption aria-hidden="true">mydraft.cc</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ol start="8" type="1">
      <li>Test out your prototype with user testing</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now find a new group of people to test out your prototype.
      Ideally they would be able to test both the UI and the flowchart
      (keep in mind the Metrocard machine <em>Wizard of Oz</em> tests
      with a <em>dummy</em> machine).</p>
      <p>Take notes. Have questions? Observe. How does your design brief
      need to be refined, if at all? How does your interface need to be
      refined?</p>
      <h3 id="last-step-from-prototype-to-first-version-in-code">Last
      step! From prototype to first version in code</h3>
      <p>Now that you have a refined design brief, some paper
      prototypes, digital mockups and use testing under your belt, you
      are ready to code up your interface.</p>
      <p>We will use our HTML and CSS tools to build a version of the
      interface. Use <code>&lt;a href=""&gt;</code> anchor links to jump
      between screens. <em>For this assignment, you do not need to
      actually present the functionality of the application or interface
      that you are prototyping</em>. In other words, if you are making a
      phone application interface, you do not need to code a functional
      phone! If you are building a messaging app or chatroom, you do not
      need to actually build that application. The emphasis is on the
      interface aspect.</p>
