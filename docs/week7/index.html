      Icons</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS Flexbox</li>
      <li>Google Fonts</li>
      <li>FontAwesome &lt;– actually, these are icons, despite the
      name</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We’ll start by creating a basic webpage on Glitch.com</p>
      <p>We’re going to do some <em>information design</em> and break
      down our content into logical sections. These sections are what
      I’m building, but you could have a different amount of sections,
      or different categories than mine here.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>header</li>
      <li>about</li>
      <li>values</li>
      <li>mission</li>
      <li>contact</li>
      </ul>
      We’ll start by building out our simple HTML and adding in these
      needed sections. Here’s just the
      <body>
      <p>section.</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;2&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;3&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;4&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;5&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body</code></pre>
      <p>Now I’m going to give them each I.D.’s so I can assign them
      unique CSS if I’d like to.</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;header&quot;&gt;1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;about&quot;&gt;2&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;values&quot;&gt;3&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;mission&quot;&gt;4&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;contact&quot;&gt;5&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body
`</code></pre>
      If I want to make some css that should be applied to each of the
      <div>
      <p>s in the body, I could invent a class, and set each div to have
      that class as well.</p>
      <p>for example:</p>
      <pre><code>...
&lt;div id=&quot;header&quot; class=&quot;section&quot;&gt;1&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;about&quot; class=&quot;section&quot;&gt;2&lt;/div&gt;
...</code></pre>
      But I’m going to take a different approach. Since each of these
      <div>
      s are <em>children</em> of the
      <body>
      <p>, I can use a special css indicator that says <em>select all
      div that are children of the body</em>.</p>
      <p>It looks ilke this:</p>
      <pre><code>body &gt; div {
  width: 100%;
  min-height: 30vh;
}</code></pre>
      <p>Recall that vh stands for <em>viewport units</em>. I specified
      a minimum height instead of just a height. This will allow the
      page to scale to different screen sizes.</p>
      To help me debug, I’ll add a border property so I can properly see
      the edges of all
      <div>
      <p>s normally-invisible css box model.</p>
      <pre><code>border: solid 1px blue;</code></pre>
      <h3 id="centering">Centering</h3>
      <p>We haven’t yet put content in these blocks, but let’s get ready
      for it by adding CSS to center the content in each div
      horizontally and vertically. We’ll do this with flexbox.</p>
      <p>We will set each section to be its own flexbox by adding in
      <code>display: flex;</code></p>
      <p>We’ll justify-content to the center.</p>
      <p>We’ll align-items to the center as well.</p>
      <pre><code>body &gt; div {
  width: 100%;
  min-height: 30vh;
  border: solid 1px blue;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}</code></pre>
      <p>Now we can go in and differentiate our sections with different
      colors.</p>
      <p>You can decide your own palette of colors, or visit a website,
      for example w3Schools <a
      href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_palettes.asp">color
      palettes</a> or <a href="https://coolors.co/">coolors.co</a>.</p>
      <p>For simplicity and readability, I’m going to use a 4-color
      pallete: 1 bright stand-out color, 2 subtle background offwhite
      colors, and black for most text.</p>
      <p>I start by giving a nice standout color background for the top
      header, and white to the text, that will contrast nicely. I could
      also add some font-size styling here as well.</p>
      <p>I also want the elements inside my header to flow top to
      bottom, so I’ll add <code>flex-direction: column;</code>. Remember
      that we set each individual block to be its own flexbox earlier in
      our CSS.</p>
      <pre><code>#header {
  background-color: #4040a1;
  color: #ffffff;
  flex-direction: column;
}</code></pre>
      <p>For readability’s sake, we will have the rest of the page’s
      blocks alternate with white values. The background color is white
      by default, so we only need to pick an offwhite color as well and
      assign it to the alternating blocks. We’ll create a reusable
      class.</p>
      <pre><code>.bg-grey { 
  background-color: #f6f6f6 
}</code></pre>
      <p>And then we can assign it to our alternating blocks inside
      their div with <code>class="bg-grey"</code>.</p>
      <p>At this point we have the 5 sections, a header with some
      content. The top header is a bright color. The rest are
      alternating between white and grey.</p>
      <p>Now that we have these differentiated sections, let’s subdivide
      them further still. We’ll break each of the middle blocks (2, 3
      and 4) into two sections, made up of an icon on the left, and some
      text on the right.</p>
      <p>Let’s assign each of these a class <em>section</em> and place 2
      divs inside.</p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;div id=&quot;about&quot; class=&quot;section&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;small-div&quot;&gt;
    small
  &lt;/div&gt;    
  &lt;div class=&quot;big-div&quot;&gt;
    big
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>We’ll also set the flex-direction of each of their containers
      to row. <strong>Note that again we didn’t need to set its display
      to felxbox since we used that trick at the beginning to set all
      child divs of body to be flexboxs already!</strong></p>
      <h3 id="fontawesome-icons">Fontawesome icons</h3>
      <p>You can get started with Font-awesome without having to
      register.</p>
      Add the font-awesome stylesheet link in the
      <head>
      <p>section before your own stylesheet link.</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.1/css/all.css&quot; integrity=&quot;sha384-50oBUHEmvpQ+1lW4y57PTFmhCaXp0ML5d60M1M7uH2+nqUivzIebhndOJK28anvf&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>Go to the icons section of font-awesome and find an icon that
      you’d like to use.</p>
      <p>Copy the class code it gives you. Let’s put it in one of the
      small-div sections.</p>
      <p>You’ll see the icon is wayyyyy too small. Let’s add a special
      class from font-awesome. We can add the class <code>fa-10x</code>
      to make it 10 times as large. Let’s also add a color, the same as
      your header background color, to the icon on our css.</p>
      <h3 id="responsiveness">Responsiveness</h3>
      <p>Okay, we’re starting to get somewhere, but this won’t look good
      on small screens yet. We can add <code>flex-wrap: wrap;</code> to
      our section class so when we’re on a small screen it will bump the
      next div down.</p>
      <h3 id="clean-up">Clean-up</h3>
      <p>Let’s make the details look nice.</p>
      <p>We can add some padding.</p>
      <pre><code>.section &gt; div {
  padding: 30px;
}</code></pre>
      <p>Let’s also remove the margin around the body, which is about
      2pixels by default on most browsers.</p>
      <pre><code>body {
  margin: 0;
}</code></pre>
      <h3 id="add-some-content">Add some content</h3>
      <p>At this point I add in more dummy text and icons.</p>
      <p>I’ll remove the border red line.</p>
      <p>And our style sucks. It’s really bad and uninviting. Let’s fix
      our fonts first by looking on Google fonts.</p>
      We covered how to use Google fonts in a previous class. Remember
      that you must link to the font’s stylesheet prior to your own
      stylesheet in the
      <head>
      <p>section of your html page.</p>
      <h2 id="workshop-continuing-iterative-design-process">Workshop:
      Continuing Iterative Design Process</h2>
      <h3 id="internal-reviews">Internal reviews</h3>
      <p>This is done with your own team/collaborators. Fast, find your
      best goals. Not as favored as independent user interviews.</p>
      <h3 id="user-interviews">User interviews</h3>
      <p>Convene at least five interviewees. Ask them questions relating
      to the design brief. This is considered the most ideal approach to
      follow when it’s feasible.</p>
      <p>Example questions: - what challenges do they face? - what do
      they already use to accomplish that task/activity? - show them
      prototypes - what do they like/dislike about this plan? - what
      similar programs do they like? - what would they change?</p>
      <p>The goal is to gather research/data, then update your design
      brief.</p>
      <h3 id="usability-testing">Usability Testing</h3>
      <p>Now is the time to gather people to test your design. You’ll
      let them interact with your prototype, by pressing, clicking,
      potentially “even Wizard of Oz” approaches like we learned about
      from David Reinfurt’s test of the prototype Metrocard screens.</p>
      <p>Like our earlier co-designing session it’s best to observe
      rather than engage in a back-and-forth conversation as you do not
      want to influence their actions. Ask questions to find out what
      the user likes, dislikes, finds intuitive, confusing, and whether
      it meets their needs.</p>
      <h3 id="refinement-and-building">Refinement and Building</h3>
      <p>Based on user usability testing you’ll go back to the design
      and refine it. You made need to do more usability testing.</p>
      <p>Based on this work it’s time to build the interface by
      translating your revised prototype into code.</p>
      <h3 id="user-testing-and-refinement-loop">User Testing (and
      Refinement) Loop</h3>
      <p>Like our earlier usability testing, after you’ve built the
      first version of the interface in code you’ll need to test and
      observe its use. Based on this you will likely need to do
      successive layers of building, refinement and testing until you
      get to a final version everyone is happy with.</p>
      <h3 id="refinement-and-building-1">Refinement and Building</h3>
      <p>Based on user usability testing you’ll go back to the design
      and refine it. You made need to do more usability testing.</p>
