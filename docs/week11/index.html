      accessible</h3>
      <p>It is most efficient and effective to incorporate accessibility
      from the very beginning of projects, so you don’t need go back and
      to re-do work.</p>

      <p>Basic considerations to help you get started making your user
      interface design and visual design more accessible to people with

      Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) requirements.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
      <li>Provide sufficient contrast between foreground and
      background</li>
      <li>Don’t use color alone to convey information</li>
      <li>Ensure that interactive elements are easy to identify</li>
      <li>Provide clear and consistent navigation options</li>
      <li>Ensure that form elements include clearly associated
      labels</li>
      <li>Provide easily identifiable feedback</li>

      of Web Users</a></p>
      <h3 id="page-title">Page Title</h3>
      <p>Good page titles are particularly important for orientation —
      to help people know where they are and move between pages open in
      their browser. The first thing screen readers say when the user
      goes to a different web page is the page title.</p>
      <h3 id="image-text-alternatives-alt-text">Image text alternatives
      (“alt text”)</h3>
      <p>Text alternatives (“alt text”) convey the purpose of an image,
      including pictures, illustrations, charts, etc. Text alternatives
      are used by people who do not see the image. (For example, people
      who are blind and use screen readers can hear the alt text read
      out; and people who have turned off images to speed download or
      save bandwidth can see the alt text.)</p>
      <p>You don’t usually see the alt text. It is in the web page
      markup like this:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;img src=&quot;pointer_to_image.png&quot; alt=&quot;here&#39;s where the alternative text goes&quot;&gt;).</code></pre>
      <h3 id="headings">Headings</h3>
      <p>All pages should have headings, marked up properly.</p>
      <p>e.g.</p>
      <pre><code>Heading level 1 &lt;h1&gt;
  heading level 2 &lt;h2&gt;
     heading level 3 &lt;h3&gt;
     heading level 3 &lt;h3&gt;
  heading level 2 &lt;h2&gt;
     heading level 3 &lt;h3&gt;
       heading level 4 &lt;h4&gt;
       heading level 4 &lt;h4&gt;
  heading level 2 &lt;h2&gt;</code></pre>
      <h3 id="contrast-ratio">Contrast Ratio</h3>
      <p>Some people cannot read text if there is not sufficient
      contrast between foreground and background.</p>
      <h3 id="resize-text">Resize text</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Test you can increase text size</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="keyboard-access-and-visual-focus">Keyboard access and
      visual focus</h3>
      <p>Many people cannot use a mouse and rely on the keyboard to
      interact with the Web. People who are blind and some sighted
      people with mobility impairments rely on the keyboard or on
      assistive technologies and strategies that rely on keyboard
      commands, such as voice input. Accessible websites enable people
      to access all content and functionality — links, forms, media
      controls, etc. — through a keyboard.</p>
      <h3 id="moving-flashing-blinking-content">Moving, Flashing,
      Blinking Content</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Check if there is any moving, blinking, or scrolling
      information that starts automatically and lasts more than five
      seconds. If there is, check that there is a way for the user to
      pause, stop, or hide the movement.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="multimedia-alternatives">Multimedia alternatives</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Captions, descriptions, text transcriptions</li>

      <h2 id="accessibility-principles">Accessibility Principles</h2>
      <p>Source: Information from W3C Web Accessibility Initiative
      (WAI)</p>
      <p>Text alternatives are equivalents for non-text content.
      Examples include:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Short equivalents for images, including icons, buttons, and
      graphics</li>
      <li>Description of data represented on charts, diagrams, and
      illustrations</li>
      <li>Brief descriptions of non-text content such as audio and video
      files</li>
      <li>Labels for form controls, input, and other user interface
      components</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Text alternatives convey the purpose of an image or function to
      provide an equivalent user experience. For instance, an
      appropriate text alternative for a search button would be “search”
      rather than “magnifying lens”.</p>
      <h3 id="captions-and-other-alternatives-for-multimedia">Captions
      and other alternatives for multimedia</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Text transcripts and captions for audio content, such as
      recordings of a radio interview</li>
      <li>Audio descriptions, which are narrations to describe important
      visual details in a video</li>
      <li>Sign language interpretation of audio content, including
      relevant auditory experiences</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="content-can-be-presented-in-different-ways">Content can be
      presented in different ways</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>For users to be able to change the presentation of content, it
      is necessary that:</li>
      <li>Sequences of information or instructions are independent of
      any presentation</li>
      <li>Browsers and assistive technologies provide settings to
      customize the presentation</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="content-is-easier-to-see-and-hear">Content is easier to
      see and hear</h3>
      <p>Distinguishable content is easier to see and hear. Such content
      includes:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Color is not used as the only way of conveying information or
      identifying content</li>
      <li>Default foreground and background color combinations provide
      sufficient contrast</li>
      <li>When users resize text up to 400% or change text spacing, no
      information is lost</li>
      <li>Text reflows in small windows (“viewports”) and when users
      make the text larger</li>
      <li>Images of text are resizable, replaced with actual text, or
      avoided where possible</li>
      <li>Users can pause, stop, or adjust the volume of audio that is
      played on a website</li>
      <li>Background audio is low or can be turned off, to avoid
      interference or distraction</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="operable-user-interface-and-navigation">Operable user
      interface and navigation</h3>
      <p>Functionality is available from a keyboard</p>
      <p>Many people do not use the mouse and rely on the keyboard to
      interact with the Web. This requires keyboard access to all
      functionality, including form controls, input, and other user
      interface components.</p>
      <h3 id="users-have-enough-time-to-read-and-use-the-content">Users
      have enough time to read and use the content</h3>
      <h3
      id="content-does-not-cause-seizures-and-physical-reactions">Content
      does not cause seizures and physical reactions</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Warn users before flashing content is presented, and provide
      alternatives</li>
      <li>Provide mechanisms to switch off animations, unless they are
      essential</li>
      </ul>
      <h3
      id="users-can-easily-navigate-find-content-and-determine-where-they-are">Users
      can easily navigate, find content, and determine where they
      are</h3>
      <h3
      id="users-can-use-different-input-modalities-beyond-keyboard">Users
      can use different input modalities beyond keyboard</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Labels presented to users match corresponding object names in
      the code, to support activation by voice</li>
      <li>Buttons, links, and other active components are large enough
      to make them easier to activate by touch</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="text-is-readable-and-understandable">Text is readable and
      understandable</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Identifying the primary language of a web page, such as
      Arabic, Dutch, or Korean</li>
      <li>Using the clearest and simplest language possible, or
      providing simplified versions</li>
      </ul>
      <h3
      id="many-people-rely-on-predictable-user-interfaces-and-are-disoriented-or-distracted-by-inconsistent-appearance-or-behavior.">Many
      people rely on predictable user interfaces and are disoriented or
      distracted by inconsistent appearance or behavior.</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Navigation mechanisms that are repeated on multiple pages
      appear in the same place each time</li>
      <li>User interface components that are repeated on web pages have
      the same labels each time</li>
      <li></li>

      <blockquote>
      <p>In most cases, including users in evaluation involves: getting
      a few people with disabilities - and depending on your target
      audience, older users including them throughout the development
      process to complete sample tasks on prototypes so you can see how
      the different aspects of the design and coding could be improved
      discussing accessibility issues with them. <em>–<a
