      Voice Design Process For Voice User Interfaces (VUIs)</h3>
      <p>Voice User Interfaces are still an early technology, though
      they have connection to previous interfaces such as Command Line
      Interfaces. Because they are a recent mass-use technology, the
      process of designing a VUI is still developing.</p>
      <p>One method based on our iterative design model for creating
      GUIs, adapted with additional steps for voice. - <a

      <h3 id="glossary-alexa">Glossary (Alexa):</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Wake word —this is the key for Alexa to start listening.</li>
      <li>Launch —a connector word to link the wake word and invocation
      name. Supported words include: ask, tell, open, launch, run,
      begin, and more.</li>
      <li>Invocation name —this is a custom phrase that customers say to
      invoke your skill. It is generally two–three words long and
      closely related to the skill’s functionality.</li>
      <li>Utterance —this is the specific phrase that the user wants to
      take action on with the skill.</li>
      <li>One-shot utterance —the top example is a one-shot utterance,
      where all information is given at once and fully satisfies what is
      needed to activate an intent.</li>
      <li>Slot value —a variable part of an utterance. In our
      travel-planning scenario, the starting location, destination,
      activity, and date are all slot values.</li>
      <li>Intent —an action that the skill can handle. A single intent
      can have many different utterances, with or without slots to
      account for what users may say.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="basic-user-interface-guidelines">Basic user interface
      guidelines:</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Express intentions in examples</li>
      <li>Limit the amount of information
      <ul>
      <li>Recommended: do not list more than 3 different options per
      interaction</li>
      <li>with a longer list of options, group them into subcategories.
      Start with the most popular options, then ask if they would like
      more options.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Use some form of simple visual feedback to let the user know
      when the system is listening</li>
      </ul>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>Make It Clear that the User Needs to Respond</li>
      <li>Don’t Assume Users Know What to Do</li>
      <li>Clearly Present the Options</li>
      <li>Keep It Brief</li>
      <li>Avoid Overwhelming Users with Too Many Choices</li>
      <li>Offer Help for Complex Skills</li>
      <li>Ask Only Necessary Questions</li>
      <li>Use Confirmation Selectively</li>
      <li>Obtain One Piece of Information at a Time</li>

      <p>We’ve now read how humans like to anthropomorphize their
      machines, and some of the reasons digital assistants have
      historically received feminine names. If you were designing a
      digital assistant, what choices would you make in its design?
      Would it have a name? A gender? Describe how you would design the
      assistant and why you’ve made those choices.</p>
