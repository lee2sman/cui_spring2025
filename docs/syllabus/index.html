      <h3 id="course-description">Course Description</h3>
      <p>Introduces concepts and skills used in analyzing and designing
      interfaces for computer applications. As students study techniques
      and “rules of thumb,” they discover that the design and
      implementation of each interface is a unique challenge, which
      requires creativity and consideration of technical, aesthetic, and
      psychological factors.</p>
      <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
      <p>This course is a broad overview of creating user interfaces
      (abbreviated: UIs), approaching the subject from a variety of
      perspectives. We will both study its history as well as work on
      practical programming exercises. We will cover user interfaces in
      general and concentrate on a progression of subjects: 1. Text User
      Interfaces 2. Graphical User Interfaces 3. Voice User Interfaces
      4. Speculative User Interfaces. We will also study issues of
      accessibility.</p>
      <p>Learning will come from a range of sources and backgrounds
      including academic articles, blog posts, code, podcasts, and
      videos. We will take an academic and computer science approach to
      interface design, but we will also look at best practices from
      today's applications, web sites, conversational UIs and other
      areas of interface design.</p>
      <h3 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Ability to explain the history of user interfaces and
      demonstrate knowledge of contemporary approaches and speculative
      research</li>
      <li>Demonstrate knowledge of entire iterative design process for
      creating successful user interfaces from ideation and paper and
      software prototypes to user testing and deployment</li>
      <li>Demonstrate successfully designed user interfaces based on
      specified tasks, user needs and use descriptions incorporating
      best practices for accessibility</li>
      <li>Produce a variety of interfaces including text user
      interfaces, graphical user interfaces, voice user interfaces and
      speculative interfaces</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
      <li>Bring a paper notebook and pen to class each week. We will use
      this extensively when sketching prototypes of interfaces before
      turning to code. Do not underestimate how much this speeds up your
      iterative design process.</li>
      <li>Back up your work! The dog ate my hard drive, etc etc, won’t
      be accepted.</li>

      id="official-purchase-college-academic-integrity-policy">Official
      Purchase College Academic Integrity Policy</h2>
      <blockquote>
      <p>The Purchase College academic integrity policy, <a
      href="https://www.purchase.edu/live/blurbs/840-academic-and-professional-integrity">purchase.edu/live/blurbs/840-academic-and-professional-integrity</a>,
      explicitly forbids cheating, plagiarism, and other forms of
      academic dishonesty. Plagiarism is the appropriation or imitation
      of the language, ideas, and/or thoughts of another person and the
      representation of them as one’s own original work. Students are
      responsible for familiarizing themselves with the definition of
      plagiarism and the acceptable methods of attribution.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Violation of any of the above may lead to formal disciplinary
      action and the following sanctions: - Minimum Sanction: Failing
      grade on the assignment or examination. Maximum Sanction:
      Expulsion - Recommended Sanction (First Offense): Failing grade
      for the course - Recommended Sanction (Second Offense):
      Expulsion</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Students who have any questions or doubts about whether any
      activity is academically permissible should check with the
      instructor.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Plagiarism and cheating are taken seriously. You will be held
      accountable for Purchase’s <a
      href="https://www.purchase.edu/offices/community-standards/student-code-of-conduct/section-a-academic-integrity/index.php">Student
      Code of Conduct for Academic Integrity</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="class-policy-on-collaboration">Class policy on
      Collaboration</h3>
      <p>I support collaborative learning with some important
      caveats.</p>
      <p>Coding can be difficult, and struggling with the material is
      part of the learning process. Students are allowed to collaborate
      to learn from each other. Do not collaborate in order to simply
      find out a solution to a project. Each participant should
      contribute approximately equally, and what you turn in should be
      your own. Copying a solution from another student, even if you
      change a few minor things such as variable names, is not a
      collaboration. You may help someone learn something, but you can
      not tell them what to code. If you have questions about
      collaboration or academic integrity, get in touch with me via
      email, talk with me before or after class, or come to office
      hours.</p>
      <h2 id="tutoring-support">Tutoring Support</h2>
      <p>All students at Purchase College can take advantage of our
      tutoring services in the Learning Center and the Einstein Corner.
      This semester these will be held online via Zoom. These are free,
      45-minute, peer-to-peer tutoring sessions in a variety of subjects
      and in writing across the disciplines. I encourage you to take
      advantage of this service to help you excel in this class, as well
      as your other courses. Please visit the <a
      href="https://www.purchase.edu/offices/learning-center/index.php">Learning
      Center</a> and <a
      href="https://www.purchase.edu/academics/school-of-natural-social-sciences/academic-support/index.php">Einstein
      Corner</a> websites for more information. Einstein Corner has
      tutors for CS1 classes.</p>
      <h1 id="homework">Homework</h1>
      <p>All work is to be submitted on time before our class starts
      each week. I ask for work to be turned in before class so I have
      time to review it so I know how you are doing. For each day late,
      your grade will drop a part letter grade.</p>
      <h1 id="accessiblity-statement">Accessiblity Statement</h1>
      <p>It is my goal that this class be an accessible and welcoming
      experience for all students, including those with disabilities.
      You are welcome to talk to me at any point in the semester about
      course design concerns, but it is always best if we can talk as
      soon as possible about the need for any modifications. The Office
      of Disability Resources collaborates directly with students who
      identify documented disabilities to create accommodation plans,
      including testing accommodations, in order for students to access
      course content and validly demonstrate learning. For those
      students who may require accommodations, please call or email the
      Office of Disability Resources, (914) 251-6035,
      odr@purchase.edu.</p>
      <h1 id="tentative-nature-of-syllabus">Tentative Nature of
      syllabus</h1>
      <p>If needed, this syllabus and the course outline may be revised
      to better suit the class. Students are responbile for keeping up
      with any changes distributed via email or in class. The most up to
      date syllabus will always be linked from Moodle.</p>
      <h1 id="classroom-community">Classroom Community</h1>
      <h2 id="community-health-during-covid-19">COMMUNITY HEALTH DURING
      COVID-19:</h2>
      <p>To ensure that each of us has a healthy and safe learning
      experience, all students are required to remain informed and
      follow Purchase College Policy and/or any departmental, local,
      state, or federal laws, rules, or regulations for attending
      classes on campus and in a remote learning environment.</p>
      <p>Within courses that involve in-person contact, all students,
      faculty members, staff, and visitors are required to adhere to the
      expectations outlined on the College’s COVID-19 website. Failure
      to comply with requirements (e.g. wearing masks, maintaining
      social distancing where applicable) will result in the request to
      leave the classroom for that in-person class session. Students may
      also be referred to the Office of Community Standards.</p>
      <p>Do not enter campus buildings if you test positive for or are
      experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19. Contact your faculty and
      Health Services if you need to miss class because of COVID-19
      symptoms or a positive COVID-19 test result. The
      conservatory/school will address on a case by case basis student
      absences due to COVID-19, while awaiting test results, or during
      quarantine.</p>
      <h2 id="attendance">Attendance</h2>
      <p>Please don’t miss our class. We only have one of these a
      week!</p>
      <p>Learning programming is a cumulative effort. More than most
      other courses each of our classes will build on what you have
      learned in previous classes. Missing class sets you back in this
      process. It is important that you attend every class.</p>
      <p>Here’s my policy: Three absences will lower your grade by one
      letter. (i.e. an A will became a B). With each additional
      unexcused absences, the grade will drop an additional unit for
      each absence. I will take attendance at the beginning of class. If
      there is an emergency or otherwise extenuating circumstance that
      prevents you from attending class, please email me.</p>
      <p>We will be covering critical concepts and working on code and
      projects in-class and you are responsible for reviewing our class
      site and reaching out to your peers outside of class time to catch
      up on what you have missed.</p>
      <h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>
      <p>We are all learners and educators. Your experience and
      participation is valid and necessary. I am not the sole source of
      information. You are responsible for and encouraged to be in
      charge of your own education. Leap forth into areas of interest.
      Teach with and learn from others.</p>
      <p>Please hold me accountable and point out areas that need to be
      improved.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Help each other out. Ask lots of questions of me and your
      fellow students.</li>
      <li>Learning to program is failure followed by success.</li>
      <li>If you are feeling left behind, stuck, or frustrated in any
      way, please let me know immediately. I am here to help.</li>
      <li>Sleep enough hours. Good sleep will get you through college,
      reduce stress, help you do well in class, and feel better. And
      it’s free.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="statement-of-values-and-code-of-conduct">Statement of
      Values and Code of Conduct</h3>
      <p>–<em>with acknowldegement and thanks, adapted from Everest
      Pipkin</em></p>
      <p>It is my intent to lead a course that serves students from
      diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and that our varied life
      experiences may enter the classroom as a resource, strength and
      benefit. I will address you by your name and pronouns and make
      arrangements to address disabilities or religious needs.</p>
      <p>Free exchange of ideas and critique is encouraged and expected
      but I will not tolerate harassment, including threats of violence,
      deliberate intimidation, unwelcome sexual attention, and offensive
      comments related to gender identity and expression, sexual
      orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability,
      class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age,
      skill level, occupation, or background. During class discussion
      and critique we aim to speak and to listen, be mindful and
      generous in our interactions, and make everyone feel heard.</p>
      <h3 id="requesting-help-on-homeworkcodeprojects">Requesting Help
      on homework/code/projects</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>When you get stuck on a problem with your code and can’t
      figure it out, take a good break such as taking a walk before
      coming back to try again. Try to explain your code’s logic to a
      friend or family member, even someone who doesn’t code.</li>
      <li>You may wish to visit Einstein’s Corner.</li>
      <li>When you are sending me code, please send a <a
      href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">minimal version</a>,
      what you expected, and what you are getting. Please don’t message
      me last minute. It can take me up to 24 hours to respond to
      emails, and longer on weekends or at the end of semesters. It is
      generally better for us to review your code together at office
      hours.</li>
