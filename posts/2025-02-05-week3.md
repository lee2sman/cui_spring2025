### Earliest concepts for what a computer (and its interface) may look like

### C.J. Licklider's 'Man-Computer Symbiosis'

-   1960

Proposed three modes of interfaces with computers:

-   *desk surfaces* - can be drawn on and interpreted by the computer
-   *networked wall and desk displays* - for collaboration and for input
    to the computer
-   *speech recognition* - to give input to the computer

### Psychologist Donald Norman

> 'the real problem with the interface is that it is an interface.
> Interfaces get in the way. I don't want to focus my energies on an
> interface. I want to focus on the job. When I use my computer , it is
> in order to get a job done: I don't want to think of myself as using a
> computer, I want to think of myself as doing my job.'

### David Reinfurt on designing the MetroCard ticket machine interfaces

MTA ticket machine interface models:

-   pre-existing system
-   Parking machine model - User places card in then adds money
-   Vending Machine model - first you insert money, then you click on
    what you want
-   ATM Model - carefully walks you through every step, lots of
    intermediate steps and feedback

Which did users prefer in tests?


## Learnability

-   Human Memory
-   interaction styles
-   user models vs system models
-   learnability principles

### UX Interface

![testfairy interface](testfairy.png)

This is the install screen for Testfairy, an app for Android that lets
developers test out apps before releasing them to a wider public.

This screen is essentially like a full size dialogue. It contains:

-   basic info
-   a link to install the app
-   info on how to use the app
-   marketing text
-   contact info
-   link to read terms
-   the ability to report spam
-   Unsubscribe

That is a lot of text for an app interface. It contains a link to
download the app as well as instructions to use the app, which you'd
have to memorize as clicking to install and opening the app would be on
a separate screen.

This is not very learnable!

### Human short-term memory

One model for understanding human memory is that we have working memory
and longterm memory. Working memory is where we do our active
*thinking*. Studies generally indicate we have a limited amount of
elements we can actively engage with in our short term memory, generally
framed as around 7 items.

We need to limit the user's options so as not to overload their active
working memory.

### Three types of interaction styles

1.  Command language
2.  Menus / forms
3.  Direct maniulation

### 1. Command language

The command line is a command language. These are the earliest type of
computer interfaces (see week 1 notes).

As an example, a Google/DuckDuckGo/Bing search bar creates a command
language query.

`computer science site:purchase.edu`

We can consider a Voice User Interface as another manifestation of a
command language.

### 2. Menus / forms

Menus / form interfaces are a more recent interaction model than command language but have been around at least since the 80s. The earliest websites (90s) behave this way.

Dialog boxes are essentially simplified forms.

They can provide a clear if unglamorous interface.

![form](form.png)  

### 3. Direct manipulation

Direct manipulation is the term we use for a interface where a user
interacts with a visual representation of a data object.

-   There are physical actions such as dragging on scrollbars or
    pressing a button
-   fast, incremental, reversible
-   immediate visual indication of an action taking effect

### Compare interaction styles

-   learnability - short-term working memory
-   consider which requires the user to hold more things in their head
    at once
-   error feedback
-   think of errors on the command line vs the error of dragging a
    scrollbar too far
-   efficiency
-   which is faster for experts?
-   can direct manipulation be efficient?
-   user types
-   which is better for experts?
-   for beginners?
-   **programming difficulty**
-   command languages are relatively easy to create
-   direct manipulations requires graphics which require both commands
    as well as creating the visual interface
-   accessibility
-   command languages and menus and forms are based on text so can be
    easier for vision-impaired users

### Model of a system

The **model** of a system is the sum of the constituent parts of a
system and how they work together. It describes how those parts work and
interact to make a system do something.

### System model - how the system actually works

### Interface model - the model that gets presented to the user through its interface

### User model - how the user thinks the system works

The interface model must be

-   simple
-   match the user's conception of the needed task
-   clear

Interface models should give immediate feedback. Consider what happens
when you push a button or drag a scrollbar. Feedback should be visual
but can also be audio (clicking sound for example).

Interfaces should be consistent, not surprising. For best practices,
follow what popular programs or platforms do.

Interfaces should use common words, not technical jargon.

## Homework

### Reading Response

Read David Reinfurt chapter "Touch Start to Begin" (20 minute read) about his experience as a professional designer that designed the Metrocard machines for the New York City subway.

Response: Write a short response (1/2 a page) to this reading. What did you find surprising or new to you in Reinfurtâ€™s description of the design of the MTA Metrocard screens? In your own words: what was the design methodology (sequence of design) they went through from ideation to implementation, testing, to final public version of the system?

### Complete project 1: Command Line Interface

Work with a partner to design a Command Line Interface for a program of your choice. You could make music playing software, a countdown timer, a program that reads aloud to the user, a to-do list maker, a meditation app, a sleep machine, or something else.

Create a menu by printing out options for the user.
Use the select command to run a function based on the user selection.

In class we learned you can combine command line software together. In this assignment you should consider what building blocks from BASH you will use to make your software. We can consider gluing these program bits together similar to sticking together lego blocks.

Basic script built out of separate program parts:

```sh
# this is a comment. Use them!

echo "some text" # prints text out

echo -e "some text
on two lines"

read -$ "Enter your name " yourname
#Prompts with "Enter your name" and saves in $yourname
#Don't forget variables are used starting with $

say "something" # speaks text out loud

afplay file.mp3 # plays an audio file

sleep 10 # sleeps (waits) 10 seconds
```

You are welcome to use other BASH commands and programs as well, along with our starter menu scripts.

In addition to a functional piece of software, consider how a prominent title, emojis and/or ascii art could help or hinder your software. How can color help make your interface more useable and/or fun? How can you make the program more discoverable with help?

For homework, finish your program, working with your partner on your CLI program, getting the main concept developed along with creating your working program loop. You will likely have a loop that checks for user input, then displays a result based on what the user selects from a menu.
