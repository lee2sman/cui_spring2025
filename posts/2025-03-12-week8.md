### Syntax for jQuery events

```
$('p').click(function(){
  //action here occurs when you click on a paragraph
});
```

```
$("#button1").mouseenter(function(){
  alert("You entered id button1!");
});
```

```
$("input").focus(function(){
  $(this).css("background-color", "#cccccc");
});
```

focus() is used when the user clicks on a form field.
