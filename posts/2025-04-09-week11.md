### Making your website accessible

It is most efficient and effective to incorporate accessibility from the very beginning of projects, so you don’t need go back and to re-do work.

*Source: [W3C Web Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/) from [Designing for Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/designing/)*

> Basic considerations to help you get started making your user interface design and visual design more accessible to people with disabilities. These tips are good practice to help you meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) requirements.

* Provide sufficient contrast between foreground and background
* Don’t use color alone to convey information
* Ensure that interactive elements are easy to identify
* Provide clear and consistent navigation options
* Ensure that form elements include clearly associated labels
* Provide easily identifiable feedback
* Use headings and spacing to group related content
* Create designs for different viewport sizes
* Include image and media alternatives in your design
* Provide controls for content that starts automatically

[Stories of Web Users](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/user-stories/)

### Page Title

Good page titles are particularly important for orientation — to help people know where they are and move between pages open in their browser. The first thing screen readers say when the user goes to a different web page is the page title.

### Image text alternatives ("alt text")

Text alternatives ("alt text") convey the purpose of an image, including pictures, illustrations, charts, etc. Text alternatives are used by people who do not see the image. (For example, people who are blind and use screen readers can hear the alt text read out; and people who have turned off images to speed download or save bandwidth can see the alt text.)

You don't usually see the alt text. It is in the web page markup like this:

```
<img src="pointer_to_image.png" alt="here's where the alternative text goes">).
```
 
### Headings
 
All pages should have headings, marked up properly.

e.g.

```
Heading level 1 <h1>
  heading level 2 <h2>
     heading level 3 <h3>
     heading level 3 <h3>
  heading level 2 <h2>
     heading level 3 <h3>
       heading level 4 <h4>
       heading level 4 <h4>
  heading level 2 <h2>
```

### Contrast Ratio

Some people cannot read text if there is not sufficient contrast between foreground and background.

### Resize text

* Test you can increase text size

### Keyboard access and visual focus

Many people cannot use a mouse and rely on the keyboard to interact with the Web. People who are blind and some sighted people with mobility impairments rely on the keyboard or on assistive technologies and strategies that rely on keyboard commands, such as voice input. Accessible websites enable people to access all content and functionality — links, forms, media controls, etc. — through a keyboard.

### Moving, Flashing, Blinking Content

* Check if there is any moving, blinking, or scrolling information that starts automatically and lasts more than five seconds. If there is, check that there is a way for the user to pause, stop, or hide the movement.

### Multimedia alternatives

* Captions, descriptions, text transcriptions



## Accessibility Principles 

Source: Information from W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)

Text alternatives are equivalents for non-text content. Examples include:

* Short equivalents for images, including icons, buttons, and graphics
* Description of data represented on charts, diagrams, and illustrations
* Brief descriptions of non-text content such as audio and video files
* Labels for form controls, input, and other user interface components

Text alternatives convey the purpose of an image or function to provide an equivalent user experience. For instance, an appropriate text alternative for a search button would be “search” rather than “magnifying lens”.

### Captions and other alternatives for multimedia

* Text transcripts and captions for audio content, such as recordings of a radio interview
* Audio descriptions, which are narrations to describe important visual details in a video
* Sign language interpretation of audio content, including relevant auditory experiences

### Content can be presented in different ways

* For users to be able to change the presentation of content, it is necessary that:
* Sequences of information or instructions are independent of any presentation
* Browsers and assistive technologies provide settings to customize the presentation

### Content is easier to see and hear

Distinguishable content is easier to see and hear. Such content includes:

* Color is not used as the only way of conveying information or identifying content
* Default foreground and background color combinations provide sufficient contrast
* When users resize text up to 400% or change text spacing, no information is lost
* Text reflows in small windows (“viewports”) and when users make the text larger
* Images of text are resizable, replaced with actual text, or avoided where possible
* Users can pause, stop, or adjust the volume of audio that is played on a website
* Background audio is low or can be turned off, to avoid interference or distraction

### Operable user interface and navigation

Functionality is available from a keyboard

Many people do not use the mouse and rely on the keyboard to interact with the Web. This requires keyboard access to all functionality, including form controls, input, and other user interface components.

### Users have enough time to read and use the content

### Content does not cause seizures and physical reactions

* Warn users before flashing content is presented, and provide alternatives
* Provide mechanisms to switch off animations, unless they are essential

### Users can easily navigate, find content, and determine where they are

### Users can use different input modalities beyond keyboard

* Labels presented to users match corresponding object names in the code, to support activation by voice
* Buttons, links, and other active components are large enough to make them easier to activate by touch

### Text is readable and understandable

* Identifying the primary language of a web page, such as Arabic, Dutch, or Korean
* Using the clearest and simplest language possible, or providing simplified versions

### Many people rely on predictable user interfaces and are disoriented or distracted by inconsistent appearance or behavior. 

* Navigation mechanisms that are repeated on multiple pages appear in the same place each time
* User interface components that are repeated on web pages have the same labels each time
* 

## Workshop: Exploring Web Accessibility Tools

1. Do [Easy Checks](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/) using the above identified first simle steps to check.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IZp8eUAu450?si=Jhj5_SDr6z0DTaow" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

2. Use a web accessibility tool checker like [Accessibility Checker](https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/).

3. Use the Browser's Accessibility inspector and *Check for issues*.

4. Get user feedback from the right people and skills. Things to consider include: age, background, disabilities.

> In most cases, including users in evaluation involves: getting a few people with disabilities - and depending on your target audience, older users including them throughout the development process to complete sample tasks on prototypes so you can see how the different aspects of the design and coding could be improved discussing accessibility issues with them. *--[source](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/involving-users/#range).*
