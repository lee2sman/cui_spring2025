## HTML

### content

```html5
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Title of page</h1>
      <h2>Very important subsection</h2>
        <h3>A little less important, but still</h3>
	<button>Press me</button>
	<p>Nothing will happen if you press that button. Sadly, we haven't hooked up any functionality to it yet.</p>
      <h2>Another very important subsection</h2>
      <p>A paragraph of text</p>
      <p>Another paragraph of text.</p>
      <p>This button does something.</p>
      <a href="https://www.kongregate.com/"><button>ESCAPE</button></a>
  </body>
</html>
```

## CSS

Style

Color, sizing, placement

## The Box Model

![the box model](boxmodel.gif)

### Color


```cs
body {
  /* a comment */
  background-color: lightgrey;
  color: #ffffff;
  
}
```

### sizing

```
button {
  width: 50px;
  margin: 3px;
  padding: 1em;
}
```

### Units

Things that can take sizes: width, margin, padding, font-size, and many more.

There are many alternative options for sizing. Many!

Some of these include:

* px - pixels
* em - standard width of the current element in font-size (a "M" is the standard letter). 2em is 2 times the current font.
* rem - similar to above, but is based on the *root* element.
* vw - "viewport width" - 1vw is 1% of the width of the page. 10vw is 10% of the width of the page.
* vh - "viewport height" - same as above but for height.

These are only a few of many sizing unit options you can use. 

### Placement

We will address this several ways. Later we will cover flexbox, because it is a flexible box system that works well on multiple screen sizes.

## Metrocard UI

![Metrocard ](metrocard.jpg)

![Metrocard screen](metrocard-machine.png)

## Flexbox

Flexbox layout is a relatively recent (as of 2017) addition to CSS providing an efficient, intuitive model to arrange, space out and align a series of html assets within a *container*. 

The way this works is that you define a *container*, a parent box object that your items (usually images or other html items like divs) will sit inside. You define how those items should take up the full space of the container. The items expands to take up the full space of the container.

This isn't the only way to lay out assets on a webpage or web app. It is ideal for small screen web applications. For larger layouts the CSS grid system is recommended.

![flexbox container](container.svg)  
*Flexbox container, source: [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)*


#### Flexbox - code snippets 

```
.container {
/* this is a comment in css */
/* you assign the parent container using display: flex */

  display: flex;
  
/* optional: define flex-direction as row, column, etc */
  
  flex-direction: row; /* default, if undefined */
  
/* optional: flex-wrap defines whether items fit on a single line or wrap */

  flex-wrap: wrap; /* default is nowrap */
}
```

### Justifying content

Justifying content is often used with Flexbox. It allows you to define how items spread out and take up space inside the container. You define this on the parent container.

![justify-content in flexbox](justify-content.svg)  
*Justify-content in Flexbox, source: [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)*  

```
.container {
  justify-content: space-evenly;
  
  /* other options: 
    flex-start (default), aligns to left
    flex-end, aligns to right
    center, aligns to center
    space-between
    space-around
    space-evenly
  */
}
```

/* flex-grow defines how much space an item takes up, optional */
  
  flex-grow: 2; /* this will be twice the width of other items (or height if a column) */

}


```

### Working with Fonts

Two slightly different methods:

1. Google Fonts
2. Importing custom fonts

### Google Fonts

In this method, you visit the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) website. Select a font. Click *Select this style*. From the new that opens in the interface, copy the *<link>* code into the <head> section of your html page. **Make sure you place it before your own stylesheet.**

Then, back to the Google Fonts page, copy the line from the CSS rules box. It will look like this:

```
font-family: 'Akaya Telivigala', cursive;
```

Go to your own stylesheet and paste it in the selector for the element you want to change. For example, if you want all text to use that font, then you can place it in the body section on your CSS stylesheet.


### Importing Custom Fonts

Find a font that you like online. There are tens of thousands you can use for free (check the license listed) at [DaFont.com](https://www.dafont.com/). Download the font to your computer. 

In your Glitch.com project, open the assets folder and import the font you just downloaded a moment ago. When it finishes importing, click on it and copy the URL.

Go to your stylesheet and add a font section at the top and add a name for the font (you can decide). For example:

```
@font-face {
  font-family: niceFont;
  src: url(<PASTE THE URL FROM THE ASSETS FOLDER HERE>
}
```

Don't put spaces in the font name. 

*If you are not using Glitch and instead your own webserver and editing with Atom or SublimeText or Visual Studio Code you can put your font in an assets folder and then the second line above would change to: ```src: url(assets/<font-file-name.ttf>;```*

Now you can use that font in a section on your stylesheet. For example, if you want all paragraphs to use that font:

```
p {
  font-family: niceFont;
}
```

This is the same line of text as above, but now it will apply that font to your paragraph text. If you want to change the font for your entire website, you can place this in body instead of p.

### Design Principles

1. Learnability
2. Visibility
3. Efficiency
4. Error prevention / error handling
5. User control

### Efficiency

When designing an interface, consider your *defaults*. Defaults are common answers. Consider how you may want to indicate these defaults to your users.

### Anticipation

Anticipation is the concept that good design presents all information at once. It considers a common workflow, and minimizes having to move back and forth within this workflow.

Users don't like having to move back and forth within navigation. Consider our pizza calculator apps as an example.

## Usability through Iterative Design

User-centered design 
- iterative design is considered best practice for user-centered design
- what does iterative mean?
- considered best practice for usability


### What does iterative design look like?

It's a circular process

1. Create an initial interface design 
2. Implement
3. Evaluate

**Go back to design and begin again...**

This is in contrast to an earlier design process called Waterfall.

![waterfall model of software design](waterfall.svg)  
*Waterfall model of software design, source: [Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Waterfall_model.svg)*  

The limitations of this model:

- User interface is difficult to predict and we're likely to get it wrong
- Users aren't involved in testing until near the end
- UI mistakes cause changes in requirements and design

### Iterative design process

1. Create initial interface design
2. Have users test it
3. Note problems
4. Refine interface
5. Have users test it
6. Refine interface
7. Have users test it
8. Repeat until interface issues solved

### The spiral model

This is a modification of the iterative process. We describe the earliest interfaces as *cheap* - minimal fast prototypes.

It's possible to make multiple alternatives to consider and test. Remember David Reinfurt's alternative UI prototypes for the Metrocard machine.

Start with a paper/pencil sketch! Earliest interfaces should be considered *throw-away*.

Later iterative designs should be more detailed. THE UI should become clearer.

The more iterations the better your UI. Have every prototype get evaluated by users!

Also consider Simulation (The "Wizard of Oz" approach).

#### Prototyping

- Cheap, throw-away UI tests
- Cheapest: 
  - paper / pencil prototypes
  - "Wizard of Oz" simulation
- Medium:
  - HTML
- GUI implementation:
  - native vs web GUI

## Paper prototyping - Wireframing

## Units of measurement

There are 5+ ways to specify sizes in CSS!

They are: ```px```, ```em```, ```rem```, ```%``` and ```viewport units```.

**em** - Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font)

**rem** - Relative to font-size of the root element

**%** - Relative to the parent element

**vw** - Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport

**vh** - Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport

**vmin** - Relative to 1% of viewport's smaller dimension


```
div {
  width: 200px;
  font-size: 2em;
}
p {
  font-size: 3rem;
}
img {
  width: 50%;
}
.container {
  width: 80vw;
  height: auto;
  margin: 10vmin;
}
```

## Responsive design

What is it?

Design should respond to the user's behavior and environment. This could be based on screen size, orientation (vertical or horizontal), and platform (Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, Linux, etc).

- How do you do it?
 
``
  
1. consider your viewport width
2. use flexbox (or CSS grid) to make sizing flexible
3. pay attention to font sizes (small size on small screen = hard to read)
4. use media queries (aka set breakpoints) to resize things for small screens

### Step 1: Set the viewport width.
 
Place this somewhere in the <head> section:

```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 
```

### Step 2: Use flexbox to make sizing / placement flexible

Covered earlier in class. See Flexbox notes.

#### Step 3: Consider font sizes. Use different sizing that may be more flexible for your needs. Examples include viewport units.

If the CSS width property is set to 100% of the viewport, the image will be responsive and scale up and down:
 
A better solution, in many cases, will be to use the max-width property instead so that it is not larger than the screen.

### Step 4: Media Queries

In the example below, if the user's screen is less than 800 pixels then the container class (which has been set previously as a flexbox with default settings) will have the flex-direction be changed to column view. This is a good approach when you want to change from a horizontal sequence of divs to a vertical orientation on a phone.

```
/* Use a media query to add a breakpoint at 800px: */
@media screen and (max-width: 800px) {
  .container {
      flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```

### Homework

### HTML / CSS practice

Using HTML + CSS, and based off tutorials on HTML, CSS and placement with CSS and flexbox, mock up this Metrocard screen.

![Metrocard interface](metrocard.jpg)

This is a test in using CSS for colors, fonts, placement.

Start by adding all of the elements you need to a HTML page.

What things need to be grouped together into a container? Those things should sit in a Div that you specify.

Practice specifying sizes.

Keep in mind there isn't a single definitive way to do this assignment. There will be multiple 'correct' ways to do this.

Struggling and re-trying is an important part of this assignment!

New to CSS?: Assume the dimensions of the screen are 600 pixels high by 800 pixels wide.

Already experienced with HTML + CSS?: Make sure your screen works for various sizes laptops/browsers (but don't worry about phone/tablet).

Upload your completed page, or post a link to it online (for example: on glitch)

Note: I recommend doing this activity after you've finished the David Reinfurt reading as he is writing specifically about the design of these screens
